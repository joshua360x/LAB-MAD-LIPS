duck lips

## Actual Mad Lib Content

This is a face used in many teenage *social media* pictures. They stick their *noun* out in a fashion that resembles a *animal* beak. It is meant to be *same adjective*, although why anyone would think *animal* are *same adjective*, I don't know. Stay away from these girls, prolonged exposure to them may cause *medical procedure*. This is not to be confused with a kissy face, which is a girl making a face as if she were about to *verb* someone. This is an okay face under the circumstances that A: She is in a relationship and sending it to her *noun* because she's *verb* far away B: *verb* kisses to her mom or dad through skype C: It's *holiday*. If it is not under these circumstances, then it's just as *adjective* as duck lips.
